# KNN Classification Pipeline

This directory contains the results of a KNN classification pipeline.

## How to Run

The analysis was generated by the script `knn_pipeline_project_refactored.py`.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the pipeline
python main.py --pickle mini_gm_public_v0.1.p --outdir output
````

## Results

* The outputs of the pipeline are stored in the `output/` directory.
* In addition to numerical metrics and plots, a detailed report with analysis and interpretation of results is provided in:

```
interpretation.pdf
```

This document explains the meaning of the metrics, visualizations (t-SNE, ROC curves, AUC vs k), and provides executive-level insights and recommendations.
